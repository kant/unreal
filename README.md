## How to run
First, download and install DeepMind Lab
```
$ git clone https://github.com/deepmind/lab.git
```
Then build it following the build instruction. 
https://github.com/deepmind/lab/blob/master/docs/build.md

Clone this repo in `lab` directory.
```
$ cd lab
$ git clone https://github.com/miyosuda/unreal.git
```
Add this bazel instruction at the end of `lab/BUILD` file

```
package(default_visibility = ["//visibility:public"])
```

Then run bazel command to run training.
```
bazel run //unreal:train --define headless=osmesa
```

To show result after training, run this command.
```
bazel run //unreal:display --define headless=osmesa
```
